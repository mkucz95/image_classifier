# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

The project development (part 1) is where I created and trained the network.
The application part of the project is taking what I made and applying it to a command line, argument based, generalization that can be used to train and predict.
